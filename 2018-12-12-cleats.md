## Cleats
The cleats on the picture are the Hypervenom Phantom 3. In my opinion these are one of the good cleats if ypu want to buy some simple cleats.

## Pros
The cleat has many nice color ways and is very stylish. Many soccer players recommend the Hypervenom Phantom 3's as "amazing" because of how firm they are. Last the cleat is very durable for soccer

## Cons
The cleats are very narrow so if you have a wide foot they won't really fit you. One of the huge cons is that the cleat is pretty expensive and some people can't afford it.
