## Favorite Sport
My favorite sport that I love playing is soccer. For e soccer is the best sport out of all but that's just my opinion. I've played soccer for almost my whole life and I will keep playing until I get too old to play, but once I can i'm going to make sure my kid play. I also love watching soccer on the TV, I find it interesting and fun to watch. My favorite soccer teams are Barcelona, Mexico, Tigres, and many other. I know some people don't like soccer but its not that bad if you put some time in to it.

## Other Interesting Sports
My top three favorite sports are soccer, basketball, and football. I mainly like watching football I don't really play it.  Basketball on the other hand I play it and watch it, my favorite team are the LA Lakers and now that we have Lebron James in the team we are going to start beasting. My favorite player on that team is Lonzo Ball. I really don't know why I like him but he's pretty good and his dad is really funny and he has two other brothers hat are going to make it to the NBA. My favorite team in football are the New England Patriots. Tom Brady is the goat I don't care what anyone says he is the best quarterback of all time!
